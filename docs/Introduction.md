# Welcome To KileX00's Personal Repository

This is my the repository where I keep most of the personal work that I do. You may be able to find all sorts of things here, so be prepared for that as well.

If you're interested in a specific section/content, here's a quick summary, or *navigation*, if you perfer it that way.

# List of Contents

## Factuly of Electronic Engineering

As you may have guessed from the name, this is the directory where all faculty-related stuff goes. If you're interested in what's inside, feel free to take a look.

## CodeHeap

This is just a folder to keep some files that may come in handy. 


An example *(as of current contents)* would be the file **launch.json**.

	This file contains a firefox debugger template for VSCode.

Whereas, you may also notice `markdown.template.md`, which holds a cool template demonstrating various capabilities of markdown language.


# Final Word

Thank you for taking the time to read this. If you have any questions, don't be afraid to [contact](mailto:it.kristijan.jovic@gmail.com/?subject=Github%20Contact%20Redirect) me.

All the best!
