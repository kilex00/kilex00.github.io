### Calendar
This is a simple custom embeddable calendar component.
It is mostly self-sufficient but since it was copied from a project, there are some tweaks to be done.

> Known tweak #1: Remove services that aren't needed (the component had a specific use so the services were added as DI)
> Known tweak #2: Calendar has a fixed height, modify that parameter in **calendar.component.scss** file.

> WIP: Footer section information not finished, footer always shown (should be shown only if there's an event for that day).
